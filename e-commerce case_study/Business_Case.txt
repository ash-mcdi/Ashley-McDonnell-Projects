e-commerce Case Study:

Vendors:
Our company sells products supplied by third-party vendors
These vendors need to be divided into categories of regular, gold, diamond
All start at regular
If the vendor meets sales targets of 30k continuously for three months, it will be promoted to gold and get a lower commission rate of 20%
If a gold vendor meets its monthly sales targets of 50k continuously for three months it will be promoted to diamond and get a lower commission rate of 15%
If diamond vendor meets sales target of 80k, get lower commission rate 10%

An employee will become the vendor's relationship manager and will create a logon.
The system should enforce a reset password on the first login
The system should track any failed logins and lock the vendor if it has five invalid password attempts

Products:
Vendors can log in and list their products under subcategories
Vendors can add, remove, discontinue any product at any time
Anyone (including customers) can search for products on the website. Navigation via category browser. Displays a brief description of the product offering
For each product, vendors must provide its name, sales price, stock quantity and the maximum estimated days it will take to be delivered to the customer
The product should include a brief description and an option to offer a fixed discount as a percent of the standard sales price
Each sales invoice should include relevant data automatically (order id, customer id, name, billing address, shipping address, order date, due date, total discount and the net value
Sales due date will be calculated by adding the maximum number of days to be delivered for all products within an order, e.g. if two items take three days and 1 item takes five days, the system will set it as 5
The system should send a notification email to the vendor whose product has been ordered by customers
Vendors should update the ship date in the corresponding sales order
Vendors, employees and customers should be able to track relevant info about the status
Each vendor will receive the total sales amount for its products minus the total commission it pays
Each relationship manager will receive 25% of the commission received from his/her vendors, and the Supervisor overseeing the relationship managers takes 20%

Customers:
If a customer wants to buy one or more products, they need to sign up
A customer can add his or her relevant info (name, mailing address, phone number, email, credit card details, user_id, password, mobile, date of birth, gender)
The system should create a logon for the customer with the current date as the joining date
Any user signed up can add items to their shopping basket
When the user checks out, the user must provide their billing and shipping address and credit card details
Customers should be able to provide one feedback comment for products he/she has purchased
